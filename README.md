 I finally finished the Hybrid Homework. It's taken me so long mostly because of the HTML. I wanted it to look nice and so I've been putting it off so that I could actually focus and make it look nice. Also to make sure my images we all properly hybriding. Overall I'm really happy with this Homework and feel like I learned a lot from it.
